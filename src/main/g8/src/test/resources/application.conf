  # All journeys will run with the following phases and times.

  # 1. an inital ramp up phase
  #rampupTime = 1

  # 2. a usually longer phase with a constant rate

  # 3. a final ramp down phase
  #rampdownTime = 1

  # The load percentage allows to specify at what percentage of the load set in the journey (journeys.conf) this test has to run.
  # Examples:
  # 1. if the journey load is 10 jps and the loadPercentage is 60, the test will run at 6 jps
  # 2. if the journey load is 10 jps and the loadPercentage is 150, the test will run at 15 jps
  #loadPercentage = 100

  # To run a smoke test through all journeys, with one user only, set the following.
  # All load configurations will be ignored.
  #runSmokeTest=true

  # Percentages of failing journeys required for a test-run to fail
  #percentageFailureThreshold = 1

  # Perecentage of individual requests failing for a test-run to fail
  #requestPercentageFailureThreshold = 1
